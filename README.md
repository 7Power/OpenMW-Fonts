OMW Ayembedt
================

What's this?
------------
Ayembedt is a font aiming to recreate the symbolic typeface called Daedric, found in the Elder Scrolls video game series, most notably in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Its name comes from the names of the first two characters, called "Ayem" and "Bedt," in the same fashion as "alphabet,"  which is derived from "alpha" and "beta". For more information on the Daedric Alphabet, see:

Why this font?
--------------
The reason this font was created is because it is to be used in some form for the OpenMW project, an open-source project aiming to recreate the engine for the Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The existing Daedric fonts were not usable due to license incompatibilities and legal concerns.
